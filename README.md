This repo presents 2 current issues with GdUnit 4 multi-project setup under .NET

Original issue: https://github.com/godot-gdunit-labs/gdUnit4NetExamples/issues/23

## Issue 1: test project can't see resources/config in tested project

You can have things like inputs or audio tracks setup in your game. The former is stored in `project.godot`, the latter is in `default_bus_layout.tres`. I've set up the test in a way that it requires the input mapping from the game to pass. Open `Tests/project.godot` and uncomment the market line to make the test pass to see the issue.

## Issue 2: IDE namespacing is broken

Because of the `src` and `test` nesting, default namespaces generated by IDEs will have this noise.
